# Personal Project Utility Analysis
I collected data for the period from June to December 2022 and January to September 2023.
Just to paint a picture of this premise, it is a four-bedroom house with a living room, dining room, kitchen, and a double-sized garage. It shares the power meter with a detached rental unit separated into three studio units and a one-roomed unit.

What was the problem? We were gambling with the electricity bill, and I needed to find out roughly the usage per day in terms of units and eventually an average monthly bill estimate.

Data collection process
1. Observation: I monitored how many units we were using in a day or 24 hours.
2. Recorded every payment that was being made for each month. This would indicate the total amount paid in a month plus the number of units.
   
Business Task: Identify the average monthly utility bill for power for better financial planning.

Thought process
1. What do I need to have? I need the total paid per month and the total units per month for both years. (So I need to merge and have all this information in one sheet for easier analysis.)
2. I need to find out from the above figures how many units are used on a daily and monthly basis.
   
What do I want to see, or should people immediately see, on the Excel dashboard?
1. The total amount spent on power for that period (the difference in a bar graph)
2. Of that total, what was the highest bill paid (maximum value)?
3. Of the total value, what was the lowest bill paid during that period?
4. The difference in consumption between the two periods or years (progressive with a bar chat)
